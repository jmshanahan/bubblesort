# Introduction

A typescript implementation of sorting

Initially it used sorting with interfaces and then it was converted to an abstract class.
It also shows how to set up a typescript project. It uses two packages nodemon and concurrently to convert the code to javascript and then execute the javascript using nodemon.

Overall a very simple project but a nice foundation on which to base projects on.
